* Return true if given object is one of PostgreSQL's built-in objects.

* We use FirstBootstrapObjectId as the cutoff, so that we only consider
* objects with hand-assigned OIDs to be "built in", not for instance any
* function or type defined in the information_schema.
*
* Our constraints for dealing with types are tighter than they are for
* functions or operators: we want to accept only types that are in pg_catalog,
* else deparse_type_name might incorrectly fail to schema-qualify their names.
* Thus we must exclude information_schema types.
*
* XXX there is a problem with this, which is that the set of built-in
* objects expands over time.  Something that is built-in to us might not
* be known to the remote server, if it's of an older version.  But keeping
* track of that would be a huge exercise.
