/*
 * ResourceArray is a common structure for storing all types of resource IDs.
 *
 * We manage small sets of resource IDs by keeping them in a simple array:
 * itemsarr[k] holds an ID, for 0 <= k < nitems <= maxitems = capacity.
 *
 * If a set grows large, we switch over to using open-addressing hashing.
 * Then, itemsarr[] is a hash table of "capacity" slots, with each
 * slot holding either an ID or "invalidval".  nitems is the number of valid
 * items present; if it would exceed maxitems, we enlarge the array and
 * re-hash.  In this mode, maxitems should be rather less than capacity so
 * that we don't waste too much time searching for empty slots.
 *
 * In either mode, lastidx remembers the location of the last item inserted
 * or returned by GetAny; this speeds up searches in ResourceArrayRemove.
